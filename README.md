# rxjs-grpc-minimal

Based off the great work of [rxjs-grpc](https://github.com/kondi/rxjs-grpc). However, this library intends to
very litle except to offer you to wrap your server or client GRPC implementation the way you want it.

There is no cli as this library is trying to stay out of the way and allow grpc, or protobufjs do the amazing things they already do.
